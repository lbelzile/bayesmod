title: "Bayesian workflow and model diagnostics"
draft: true
---


## Content


- Bayesian workflow
- Model comparison and Bayes factors
- Model diagnostics (WAIC, LOO-CV, etc.)

## Learning objectives

At the end of the chapter, students should be able to

- choose suitable test statistics to evaluate model adequacy
- assess convergence and effective sample size
- perform model comparisons using Bayes factor or predictive measures
- diagnose performance of MCMC algorithms and implement potential remedies



## Readings

:::{.callout-warning}

These readings should be completed before class, to ensure timely understanding and let us discuss the concepts together through various examples and case studies --- the strict minimum being the course notes.

## Complementary readings

Complementary readings are additional sources of information that are not required readings, but may be useful substitutes. Sometimes, they go beyond the scope of what we cover and provide more details.
