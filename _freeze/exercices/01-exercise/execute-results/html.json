They interviewed public transit users over perceived traffic time and real time for buses lines operating around  Ohio State University in Columbus. Measured waiting times ranged between 3 and 15 minutes. -->\n\nConsider an independent and identically distributed sample from an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda>0$, with associated density $f(x) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x)$.\n\nCompute the marginal likelihood when the prior for $\\lambda$ is \n\na. an exponential distribution with rate $\\kappa>0$, with prior density $p(\\lambda) = \\kappa \\exp(-\\lambda\\kappa)$;\nb. same, but truncated above at 1, so the density is $p(\\lambda) = \\kappa \\exp(-\\lambda\\kappa)\\mathrm{I}\\{\\lambda \\leq 1\\}$; where $\\mathrm{I}$ is one if the condition is satisfied and zero otherwise\nc. $\\lambda \\sim \\mathsf{Ga}(\\alpha, \\beta)$, a gamma distribution with shape $\\alpha>0$ and rate $\\beta>0$, with prior density $p(\\lambda) = \\beta^\\alpha\\lambda^{\\alpha-1}\\exp(-\\beta \\lambda)/\\Gamma(\\alpha)$.\n\nDeduce that, in all cases above and up to truncation, the posterior distribution is a gamma distribution.\n\n## Exercise 1.2\n\nWe model data using an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda$, and consider the following priors\n\na. a gamma distribution with rate $\\beta=20$ and shape $\\alpha = 20$\nb. an exponential distribution with unit rate\nc. a gamma distribution with rate $\\beta=0.1$ and shape $\\alpha = 10$\nd. a uniform prior on the unit interval [0,1]\n\nSuppose we collect a random sample of size $n=10$, with average value $\\overline{y}=1.3$\n\nAssociate each plot of the posterior with each of the priors.\n\nExplain what would happen if we increased the sample size.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Posteriors (full) and scaled likelihood (dashed) for exponential data, with different priors.](01-exercise_files/figure-html/fig-betabinom-1.png){#fig-betabinom width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Exercice 1.4\n\nConsider a half Cauchy prior over the positive half line, with density $p(\\lambda) = 2\\pi^{-1}(1+x^2)^{-1}$.
