The course will cover the formulation, evaluation and comparison of Bayesian models through examples.\n\nMathematical review. Basics of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and sampling algorithms, with a focus on off the shelf software (e.g., OpenBugs, Stan, INLA). Approximation methods. Hierarchical modelling, with a focus on latent Gaussian models.\n\nThemes covered:\n\n- Introduction to the Bayesian paradigm\n- Formulation, comparison and evaluation of Bayesian models\n- Sampling algorithms and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods\n- Computational strategies for inference\n- Hierarchical models\n- Advanced topics\n\n\n# Target audience and prerequisites\n\nThe course is part of the PhD program in Administration offered by HEC Montréal jointly with McGill, Concordia and Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM). Other Québec students can register via [BCI](https://services.bci-qc.ca/eds/index_eds.html).\n\n# Course materials\n\nI will provide slides and videos. In addition to those, there will be assigned readings from textbook and reference papers.\n\n## Textbooks\n\nCourse notes for the class can be found [online](https://lbelzile.github.io/MATH80601A/)\n\nAdditional references include @Gelman:2013, @McElreath:2020 and @Johnson.Ott.Dogucu:2022.\n\n- A.

My office, 4.850, is located next to the southern elevators in Côte-Sainte-Catherine building.\n\nPlease watch this video:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/270014784\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto 1rem;\"></iframe>\n\nStudent hours are set times dedicated to all of you (most professors call these \"office hours\"; I don't^[There's fairly widespread misunderstanding about what office hours actually are! [Many students often think that they are the times I *shouldn't* be disturbed](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Can-This-Man-Change-How-Elite/245714/), which is the exact opposite of what they're for!]). This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by if you want to talk to me in person (or remotely) with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.\n\n\n## Intellectual integrity\n\nPlease don't cheat! The [official policy](https://www.hec.ca/direction_services/secretariat_general/juridique/reglements_politiques/documents/REG_intellectual-integrity-students-v2.pdf) lists the school rules regarding plagiarism and academic integrity.\n\n## Student services\n\nStudents with special needs should feel free to approach me so we can best discuss accommodations. Do check out [HEC Montréal's disabled students](https://www.hec.ca/en/students/support-resources/support-disabled-students/index.html) and [psychological] (https://www.hec.ca/en/students/support-resources/psychological-support/index.html) support services.\n\n## Harassment and sexual violence\n\nThe Center for Harassment Intervention (BIMH) is the unique access point for all members of the community subject to harassment or sexual violence. You can reach them at 514 343-7020 or by email at [`harcelement@hec.ca`](mailto:harcelement@hec.ca) from Monday until Friday, from 8:30 until 4:30pm.\n\nIf you are in an emergency situation or fear for your safety, call emergency services at 911, followed by HEC Montréal security services at 514 340-6611.\n\n[Check the school official policy on these matters](https://www.hec.ca/direction_services/secretariat_general/juridique/reglements_politiques/documents/policy-to-prevent-and-fight-sexual-violence.pdf) for more details.\n\n## Family policy\n\n\nHEC now has an [official family policy](https://www.hec.ca/direction_services/secretariat_general/juridique/reglements_politiques/documents/DIR_parents-etudes.pdf), but the following guidelines reflect my own beliefs and commitments towards parent students^[Shamelessly stolen/adapted from similar policy by Drs. Melissa Cheney, Guy Grossman and Rohan Alexander]\n\n1. Babies are welcome in class as often as necessary for support feeding relationship.\n2. You are welcome to bring your child to class in order to cover unforeseeable gaps in childcare. \n3. If you come with babies or toddler, I ask that you sit close to the door so that, in case your little one needs special attention and is disrupting the learning of other students, you may step outside of class until their needs are met. Seats close to the door are reserved for parents attending class with their child.\n\n\n\n<!-- # Evaluations and grades -->\n\n<!-- You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the [evaluations](/evaluations/) page. -->\n\n\n\n# References {-}\n",
