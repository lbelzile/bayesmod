From your prior experience, you know that measured waiting times range between 3 and 15 minutes. You collect data over the two first week of classes and get an average of 8 minutes based on 10 observations.\n\nFor modelling, we consider data to arise an independent and identically distributed sample from an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda>0$, with associated density $f(x) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x)$.\n\n## Exercise 1.1\n\n\nCompute the marginal likelihood when the prior for $\\lambda$ is \n\n1. an exponential distribution with rate $\\kappa>0$, with prior density $p(\\lambda) = \\kappa \\exp(-\\lambda\\kappa)$;\n2. same, but truncated above at 1, so the density is $p(\\lambda) = \\kappa \\exp(-\\lambda\\kappa)\\mathrm{I}\\{\\lambda \\leq 1\\}$; the indicator function $\\mathrm{I}(\\cdot)$ equals one if the condition is true and zero otherwise.\n3. $\\lambda \\sim \\mathsf{Ga}(\\alpha, \\beta)$, a gamma distribution with shape $\\alpha>0$ and rate $\\beta>0$, with prior density $p(\\lambda) = \\beta^\\alpha\\lambda^{\\alpha-1}\\exp(-\\beta \\lambda)/\\Gamma(\\alpha)$.\n\nDeduce that, in all cases above and up to truncation, the posterior distribution is a gamma distribution.\n\n## Exercise 1.2\n\nConsider the following priors for the reciprocal expected waiting time, $\\lambda$.\n\n1. a gamma with rate $\\beta=100$ and shape $\\alpha = 10$\n2. an exponential with rate $5$\n3. a uniform prior on the unit interval $[5,10]$ for $1/\\lambda$\n\nAssociate each plot of the posterior with each of the priors. Which one seems most suitable for modelling?\n\nExplain what would happen to the posterior curve if we increased the sample size.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Posteriors (full) and scaled likelihood (dashed) for exponential data, with different priors.

Using a grid approximation in increments of 0.01, evaluate the unnormalized posterior density from 0 until 30 minutes$^{-1}$. Compare this approximation with that of quadrature methods via `integrate` and return the corresponding estimates of the normalizing constant. *Indication*: check the values and make sure the output is sensical. Modify the integrand if necessary.\n\n\nPlot the posterior distribution of $1/\\lambda$, the average waiting time.\n\n## Exercice 1.4\n\nConsider $\\lambda \\sim \\mathsf{Ga}(\\alpha = 1.4, \\beta=0.2)$.\n\n1. Return the posterior mean, posterior median and maximum a posteriori (MAP).\n2. Return the 89% equitailed percentile credible interval.\n3. Return the 50% highest posterior density (HPD) interval (harder).\n\nNext, draw 1000 observations from the posterior predictive distribution and plot a histogram of the latter. Compare it to the exponential distribution of observations.\n\nWould the posterior predictive change if you gathered more data? Justify your answer and explain how it would change, if at all.\n\n\n",
