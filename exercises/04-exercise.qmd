## Exercise 4.1

Consider the Laplace family of distribution, $\mathsf{La}(\nu, \tau)$, with density
\begin{align*}
g(x; \nu, \tau) = \frac{1}{2\tau} \exp\left(- \frac{|x-\nu|}{\tau}\right), \qquad \nu \in \mathbb{R}, \tau > 0
\end{align*}
as a candidate distribution for rejection sampling from $\mathsf{No}(0,1).$

1. Provide an inversion sampling algorithm to generate from $\mathsf{La}(\nu, \tau).$
2. Can you use the proposal to generate from a standard Gaussian? for Student-$t$ with 1 degree of freedom? Justify your answer.
3. Consider as proposal a location-scale version of the Student-t with $\nu=3$
 degrees of freedom. Find the optimal location and scale parameters and the upper bound $C$ for your choice.
4. Use the accept-reject to simulate 1000 independent observations and compute the empirical acceptance rate.


## Exercise 4.2

Repeat the simulations in Example 3.6, this time with a parametrization in terms of log rates $\lambda_i$ $(i=1,2)$, with the same priors. Use a Metropolis--Hastings algorithm with a Gaussian random walk proposal, updating parameters one at a time. Run four chains in parallel.


1. Tune the variance to reach an approximate acceptance rate of 0.44.
2. Produce diagnostic plots (scatterplots of observations, marginal density plots, trace plots and correlograms). See [`bayesplot`](http://mc-stan.org/bayesplot/articles/plotting-mcmc-draws.html) or `coda`. Comment on  the convergence and mixing of your Markov chain Monte Carlo.
3. Report summary statistics of the chains.
