Next, implement a random walk Metropolis--Hastings algorithm to sample draws from the posterior and re-estimate the quantities. Compare the values.

## Exercise 4.2

Repeat the simulations in Example 3.6, this time with a parametrization in terms of log rates $\lambda_i$ $(i=1,2)$, with the same priors. Use a Metropolis--Hastings algorithm with a Gaussian random walk proposal, updating parameters one at a time. Run four chains in parallel.


1. Tune the variance to reach an approximate acceptance rate of 0.44.
2. Produce diagnostic plots (scatterplots of observations, marginal density plots, trace plots and correlograms). See [`bayesplot`](http://mc-stan.org/bayesplot/articles/plotting-mcmc-draws.html) or `coda`. Comment on  the convergence and mixing of your Markov chain Monte Carlo.
3. Report summary statistics of the chains.
