## Exercise 4.1

The Pareto distribution with shape $\alpha>0$ and scale $\tau>0$ has density
$$
f(x; \alpha, \tau) = \alpha x^{-\alpha-1}\tau^\alpha \mathsf{I}(x > \tau).
$$
It can be used to model power laws in insurance and finance, or in demography. The `uscitypopn` contains the population size of cities above 200K inhabitants in the United States, from the 2020 census.

1. Using improper priors, write the joint posterior for a simple random sample of size $n$ and derive the conditional distributions $p(\alpha \mid \boldsymbol{y}, \tau)$ and $p(\tau \mid \alpha, \boldsymbol{y})$.
2. The mononomial distribution $\mathsf{Mono}(a,b)$ has density $p(x) \propto x^a\mathsf{I}(0 \leq x \leq b)$. Find the normalizing constant for the distribution and obtain the quantile function to derive a sampler.
3. Implement Gibbs sampling for this problem for the `uscitypopn` data. Draw enough observations to obtain an effective sample size of at least 1000 observations. Hence calculate the accuracy of your estimates?


## Exercise 4.2

Implement the Bayesian LASSO for the `efron2004` cancer surgery from package `care`.  Check @Park.Casella:2008 for the details of the Gibbs sampling.

1. Fit the model for a range of values of $\lambda$ and produce parameter estimate paths to replicate Figure 1 of the paper.
2. Check the effective sample size and comment on the mixing. Is it impacted by the tuning parameter?
3. Implement the approaches in section 3 to find $\lambda$.
4. For three models with different values of $\lambda$, compute the widely applicable information criterion and use it to assess predictive performance.
