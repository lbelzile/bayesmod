## Exercise 6.1

Run four Markov chains to estimate the parameters with different starting values. Store the posterior parameters
For each posterior draw, sample a corresponding dataset from the posterior predictive with the same size as the original and Draw samples from

1. Plot the chain including burn in and warmup period. How many iterations does it take for the chains
2. Estimate the quartiles and report adjusted Monte Carlo standard errors based on the effective sample size.
3. Calculate the $\widehat{R}$ factor for each parameter.
4. **posterior predictive check: for each simulated dataset from the posterior predictive,
     a. plot their density and compare with that of the original data.
     b. Compare the posterior std. deviation and the range.
     c. Compute the leave-one-out cross validated probability integral transform
5. Compute WAIC
