Upworthy example with random effects for the 

Let $Y_{ij1}$ ($Y_{ij2}$) denote the score of the home (respectively visitor) team for a soccer match opposing teams $i$ and $j$. @Maher:1982 suggested modelling the scores as
\begin{align}
Y_{ij1} \sim \mathsf{Po}\{\exp(\delta + \alpha_i +\beta_j)\}, \quad Y_{ij2} \sim \mathsf{Po}\{\exp(\alpha_j+\beta_i)\},\qquad i\neq j; i, j \in \{ 1, \ldots, 20\}, \label{eq:mahermod}
\end{align}
where $\alpha_i$ represent the offensive strength of the team, $\beta_j$ the defensive strength of team $j$ and $\delta$ is the common home advantage. The scores in a match and between matches are assumed to be independent of one another. The data set `soccer` contains the results of football (soccer) matches for the 2015 season of the English Premier Ligue (EPL) and contains the following variables

- `score`: number of goals of `team` during a match
- `team`: categorical variable giving the name of the team which scored the goals
- `opponent`: categorical variable giving the name of the adversary
- `home`: binary variable, 1 if `team` is playing at home, 0 otherwise.


1. Specify suitable priors for the regression parameters that shrink $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_j$ to zero.
2. Fit the model characterized using the frequentist estimates as starting values and answer the following questions: 
3. Using the posterior distribution, give the expected number of goals for a match between Manchester United (at home) against Liverpool.
4. Report and interpret the estimated posterior mean home advantage $\widehat{\delta}$. 
5. What is the probability that the home advantage $\delta$ is positive?
6. Comment on the adequacy of the fit by using a suitable statistic for the model fit (e.g. the deviance statistic
7. Maher also suggested more complex models, including one in which the offensive and defensive strength of each team changed depending on whether they were at home or visiting another team, i.e.
\begin{align}
Y_{ij1} \sim \mathsf{Po}\{\exp(\alpha_i +\beta_j + \delta)\}, \quad Y_{ij2} \sim \mathsf{Po}\{\exp(\gamma_j+\omega_i)\}, \qquad i\neq j;\; i, j \in \{ 1, \ldots, 20\} \label{eq:mahermod2}
\end{align}
Does Model~\ref{eq:mahermod2} fit significantly better than Model~\ref{eq:mahermod}? Compare the models using WAIC and Bayes factors.


\textbf{Bush vs Gore}: the 2000 US presidential election opposed Georges W. Bush (GOP) and Albert A. Gore (Democrat), as well as marginal third party candidates. The tipping state was Florida, worth 25 electors, which Bush won by a narrow margin of 537 votes. 
There have been many claims that the design of so-called \href{https://www.palmbeachpost.com/storyimage/LK/20151105/NEWS/812069858/AR/0/AR-812069858.jpg}{butterfly ballots} used in poor neighborhoods of Palm Beach county led to confusion among voters and that this deprived Gore of some thousands of votes that were instead assigned to a paleoconservative third-party candidate, Patrick Buchanan (Reform). \href{https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1049993203}{Smith (2002)} analysed the election results in Palm Beach country, in which a unusually high number of ballots (3407) were cast for Buchanan. 

We are interested in building a model to predict the expected number of votes for Buchanan in Palm Beach county, based only on the information from other county votes. The \code{buchanan} data contains the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{county}: name of county
\item \code{popn}: population of the county in 1997.
\item \code{white}: percentage of ``white'' (\textit{sic}) in 1996 (per \href{https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/1990_questionnaire.pdf}{US Census definitions}; people having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa).
\item \code{black}: percentage of Black and African Americans in 1996 (origins in sub-saharian Africa).
\item \code{hisp}: percentage of Hispanics in 1996. 
\item \code{geq65}: percentage of the population aged 65 and above based on 1996 and 1997 population estimates.
\item \code{highsc}: percentage of the population with a high school degree (1990 Census data).
\item \code{coll}: percentage of the population that are college graduates (1990 Census data).
\item \code{income}: mean personal income in 1994.
\item \code{buch}: total ballots  cast for Pat Buchanan (Reform).
\item \code{bush}: total ballots cast for Georges W. Bush (GOP).
\item \code{gore}: total ballots cast for Al Gore (Democrat).
\item \code{totmb}: total number of votes cast for the presidential election in each county, minus Buchanan votes.
\end{itemize}
% \textsl{Note: there is overlap between \code{white}/\code{black} and \code{hisp}, so the three do not sum to 100\%. Since we want to predict the number of Buchanan's vote, we exclude the latter from the total number of votes cast.}
\begin{enumerate}
% \item Fit a binomial logistic model for the votes of Bush versus Gore with $\ln(\code{popn})$, \code{black}, \code{hisp}, \code{o65}, \code{highsc} as covariates. Interpret the estimated coefficients $\widehat{\bs{\beta}}$ for \code{highsc} and \code{hisp} on the odds scale.

% Everything else being constant, an increase of 1 percentage of people with high school degrees increases the odds of voting for Gore (relative to Bush) by

\item Calculate the total proportion of votes for Buchanan in Florida.
\item Plot the percentage of votes obtained by Buchanan, \code{buch}/(\code{buch}+\code{totmb}), against $\ln(\code{popn})$ and comment.

The vote share for Buchanan is higher is small (rural) counties. There is a clear outlier in the left panel of \Cref{fig:buchanan} at approximately [$13, 0.75\%]$ that corresponds to Palm Beach county. There seems to be more heterogeneity in less populated counties.

\textbf{Exclude} the results of Palm Beach county for the rest of the question.

\item We consider first a Poisson model for the percentage of votes for Buchanan, $\code{buch}/\code{totmb}$, as a function of \code{white}, $\ln(\code{hisp})$, \code{geq65}, \code{highsc}, $\ln(\code{coll})$, \code{income}. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain why an offset is necessary in this case.
\item Why is \code{totmb} a better choice of denominator than \code{popn} for the rate? Explain.
% \item Why isn't it necessary to include both \code{pbush} and \code{pgore}, the percentage of votes for two main candidates, as covariates?
\item Is the Poisson model appropriate? Justify your answer.
\item Explain why, if there is evidence of overdispersion, this means the binomial model is also inadequate. \textsl{Hint: what is the variance of the binomial distribution and how does it relate to the Poisson distribution?}
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solncomment}
\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The population in counties differ drastically, from 6.3K to 2 million voters.
\item We want the percentage of votes, so \code{totmb} --- the percentage of Buchanan's votes is less than 1.5\%, so omitting it won't affect the results much. \code{popn} would not be adequate because the percentage of inhabitants who cast a ballot differs a lot across counties, ranging from 25\% to 58\%. Part of this has to do with citizenship status (immigrants may not be entitled to vote), number of felons or age (only adults can vote). 
\item The number of trials is large, so we expect the $\chi^2$ approximation to the deviance to be adequate. The deviance statistic for the sample excluding county 50 is $D=596.25$ with $\nu=58$ residual degrees of freedom, a ratio of almost 10! There is clear evidence of overdispersion; testing whether a negative binomial model fits better yields a likelihood ratio statistic of $562.71$, suggesting overwhelming evidence against the null of equal mean-variance.
\item The variance for the binomial distribution is $N_ip_i(1-p_i)$, compared to the Poisson distribution which has $N_ip_i$. Since $p_i \approx 0.003$, this second term is negligible and there is also overdispersion for the fraction that cannot be handled directly with a binomial model.
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\item Use a negative binomial model with the same covariates to predict the expected number of Buchanan votes in Palm Beach county. Comment hence on the discrepancy between this forecast and the number of votes received in the election.
\begin{solncomment}
\begin{solution}
The predicted number of voters (rounded to the nearest unit) is $504$ voters for the negative binomial model, compared to $438$ for the Poisson model: the change in the likelihood affects the parameter estimates.

Standard software only return confidence intervals for the mean, but not for predictions.
The prediction interval combines two sources of error: the uncertainty associated to the estimated coefficients and the uncertainty arising from the distribution. Since maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically normal, we can obtain uncertainty by using this approximation. We can approximate the latter using a Monte Carlo simulation, where for each iteration 
\bi \item we sample a draw  $\boldsymbol{\beta}_b \sim \mathsf{No}_{p+1}\{\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}, j^{-1}(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\}$ and similarly for $k_b \sim \mathsf{No}\{\widehat{k}, \mathsf{se}(\widehat{k})\}$ [uncertainty of the estimated coefficients].
\item we simulate one new observation $Y_{b} \sim \mathsf{NB}(\mu_b = \exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}_b \cdot \mathbf{x}_{\text{PB}} + o), k = k_b)$, where $o$ is the offset, $\mathbf{x}_{\text{PB}}$ is the row of the model matrix corresponding to Palm Beach (including the intercept)  [uncertainty arising from the distribution of the response]
\ei 
Based on the $B$ values for the prediction, we simply compute the sample quantiles of $\mu_b$ (confidence interval for the mean) and the sample quantiles of $Y_b$ to get an approximate prediction interval With $B=10 000$ replications and looking at the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of the simulated draws, this yields a 95\% prediction interval of [260, 861], far from the observed counts.
