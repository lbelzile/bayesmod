## Exercise 2.1

Consider a simple random sample of size $n$ from the Wald distribution, with density
\begin{align*}
f(y; \nu, \lambda) = \left(\frac{\lambda}{2\pi y^{3}}\right)^{1/2} \exp\left\{ - \frac{\lambda (y-\nu)^2}{2\nu^2y}\right\}\mathrm{I}(y > 0)
\end{align*}
for location $\nu >0$ and shape $\tau>0$. 

a. Write down the likelihood and show that it can be written in terms of the sufficient statistics $\sum_{i=1}^n y_i$ and $\sum_{i=1} y_i^{-1}$.
b. Show that the joint prior
$$ p(\lambda) \sim \mathsf{Ga}(\alpha, \beta), \quad p(1/\nu \mid \lambda) \sim  \mathsf{No}(\mu, \tau^{-1}\lambda^{-1}),$$ the product of a gamma and a reciprocal Gaussian, is conjugate for the Wald distribution parameters.
c. Derive the parameters of the posterior distribution and provide an interpretation of the prior parameters. *Hint*: write down the posterior parameters as a weighted average of data-dependent quantities and prior parameters.
d. Derive the marginal posterior $p(\lambda)$.


## Exercise 2.2

Consider the Rayleigh distribution with scale $\sigma>0$. It's density is
$$f(y; \sigma) = \frac{y}{\sigma^2} \exp\left(-\frac{y^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\mathrm{I}(x \geq 0).$$

Derive the Fisher information matrix and use it to obtain Jeffrey's prior for $\sigma$. Determine whether the prior is proper.

## Exercise 2.3

Consider a binomial model with an unknown probability of successes $\theta \in [0,1]$ model. Suppose your prior guess for $\theta$ has mean $0.1$ and standard deviation $0.2$

Using moment matching, return values for the parameters of the conjugate beta prior corresponding to your opinion.


Plot the resulting beta prior and compare it with a truncated Gaussian distribution on the unit interval with location $\mu=0.1$ and scale $\sigma=0.2$.^{Note that the parameters of the truncated Gaussian distribution do not correspond to moments!}

## Exercise 2.4

Replicate the analysis of Example 2.6 (Should you phrase your headline as a question?) of the [course notes](https://lbelzile.github.io/MATH80601A/priors.html) using the `upworthy_question` data from the [`hecbayes` package](https://github.com/lbelzile/hecbayes).
