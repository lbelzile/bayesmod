Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\nInstall OS specific programs\n\n\nmacOS only: download and install XQuartz.\nWindows only: download and install Rtools\n\n\n\nInstall RStudio\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. To install the latter, follow the instructions.\n\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nThe website should automatically detect your operating system (Linux, macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\nDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\n\nInstall tidyverse\nR packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n\n\nInstall tinytex\nWhen you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX, which is complicated and a large download. To make life easier, there’s an R package named tinytex that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nTo install tinytex:\n\nUse the Packages in panel in RStudio to install tinytex like you did above with tidyverse. Alternatively, run install.packages(\"tinytex\") in the console.\nRun tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console.\nWait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need.\nYou should now be able to knit to PDF."

Indication: check the values and make sure the output is sensical. Modify the integrand if necessary.\nPlot the posterior distribution of \\(\\omega = 1/\\lambda\\), the average waiting time.\n\nSolution. For an unnormalized density \\(g(x)\\) such that \\(\\int g(x) \\mathrm{d} x = c\\), the normalizing constant is \\(1/c\\).\nFirst, remember that the density function of the scale \\(\\omega = \\lambda^{-1}\\) is related to the one of the rate \\(\\lambda\\) through a change of variable, with Jacobian \\(\\omega^{-2}\\).\n\n# Likelihood function - NOTE FORMULATION TO AVOID NUMERICAL OVERFLOW\nlik &lt;- function(x, n = 10, ybar = 8){exp(n*(log(x)-ybar*x))}\n# Density of Cauchy over positive real line\ndfoldedCauchy &lt;- function(x){2/pi/(1+x^2)}\n# Check integral\nintegrate(dfoldedCauchy, lower = 0, upper = Inf)\n\n1 with absolute error &lt; 1.6e-10\n\n# Unormalized posterior\nunnorm_post &lt;- function(x){dfoldedCauchy(x)*lik(x)}\n(icst_lambda &lt;- integrate(f = unnorm_post, 0, 100))\n\n7.074775e-15 with absolute error &lt; 1.4e-14\n\n# Check that the normalized value gives integral of 1\ncst_test &lt;- integrate(f = function(x){unnorm_post(x)/icst_lambda$value}, \n                      lower = 0,\n                      upper = 100)\n\nOuch! The integral is nearly zero, and there is significant risk of numerical underflow and the reciprocal of the integrals are one order of magnitude apart, even when the sample size is not large. The normalizing constant, the reciprocal of the marginal likelihood, is not well estimated. The absolute error is of higher order than the estimate of the marginal likelihood, and this will be more problematic in higher dimensions.\nTo palliate to this, we could slightly modify the integrand by scaling the likelihood by \\((n\\overline{y} )^{n+1}/n!\\), the normalizing constant of the gamma integral, which is around \\(2.4 \\times 10^{14}\\). This fixes the issue below.\n\n# Scale likelihood by using gamma distribution normalizing constant\nslik &lt;- function(x, n = 10, ybar = 8){\n  exp(-lgamma(n+1) + (n+1)*log(n*ybar) + n*(log(x)-ybar*x))\n}\n# Unnormalized posterior, version 2\nunnorm_post2 &lt;- function(x){dfoldedCauchy(x)*slik(x)}\n# Define grid and evaluate product\ngrid &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 30, by = 0.01)\nmarglik_grid &lt;- sum(unnorm_post2(grid))*0.01\n# Is the grid approximation good enough?\n# check equality to numerical tolerance\nall.equal(integrate(f = unnorm_post2, 0, 100)$value, marglik_grid)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nnorm_cst &lt;- 1/marglik_grid\n\nThe prior normalizing by a known constant fixes the numerical issues. Generally, one would tend to build an approximation only at the mode and match the curvature of the posterior there (using, e.g., a quadratic approximation to the posterior density).\nFor the posterior density, we can simply use the approximation with \\(p(\\lambda \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}) \\approx \\widehat{c} L(\\lambda)p(\\lambda)\\). The posterior density for the reciprocal rate is \\(p(\\omega \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}) \\approx \\widehat{c} L(\\omega^{-1})p(\\omega^{-1})\\omega^{-2}\\) (don’t forget the Jacobian)!\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot() + \n  stat_function(fun = function(x){unnorm_post2(1/x)*norm_cst/x^2},\n                xlim = c(0, 30),\n                n = 1001) +\n  labs(y = \"\", \n       x = expression(paste(\"average waiting time \", 1/lambda, \" (in minutes)\")),\n       subtitle = \"posterior density\") + \n  theme_classic()"
