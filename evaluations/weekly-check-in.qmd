title: Weekly check-in
---


Every week, after you finish working through the content, I want to hear about what you learned and what questions you still have. To facilitate this, and to encourage engagement with the course content, youâ€™ll need to write a small feedback in *ZoneCours*. This should be ~150 words.

You should answer the following three questions each week:

- What was the most exciting thing you learned from the session? Why?
- What was the muddiest thing from the session this week? What are you still wondering about?
- Which activity did you find the most useful? What could have been skipped?

The weekly check-in is an occasion for you to ask for clarification, highlight areas or topics for which examples could be added, or list superfluous activities and content. I will grade these before class, answer individually through the feedback form or at the beginning of class.
